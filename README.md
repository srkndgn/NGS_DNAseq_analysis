DNA Sequencing Analysis with Fastqc, BWA, Samtools, and BCFtools

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to analyzing DNA sequencing data using various bioinformatics tools. 

This guide focuses on the alignment of sequenced reads, variant calling, and visualization of results.

Table of Contents

1. Introduction
This workflow is designed for those who want to process DNA sequencing data, specifically for aligning reads, identifying variants, and visualizing these results.

2. Setting up the Environment
The guide starts by setting up the Anaconda environment, a powerful platform that ensures the compatibility of tools and dependencies.
Installation of necessary packages such as bwa, samtools, and bcftools is covered.

3. Data Preparation
Instructions are provided for creating necessary directories for a structured workflow.
Steps are laid out for downloading and unzipping data files, especially sequencing reads in fastq format.

4. Alignment and Variant Calling
Detailed commands for aligning reads to a reference genome using bwa are provided.
Post-alignment processes, including sorting and indexing, are explained.
The workflow for variant calling using bcftools is described in detail, leading to the generation of a VCF file that contains information about identified variants.

5. Visualization using IGV
The guide touches upon visualizing aligned reads and variants using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), an interactive visualization tool.
Directions for installing and setting up IGV are provided, along with steps for viewing specific regions of interest.

6. Conclusion
This repository offers a comprehensive guide to those new to DNA sequencing data analysis, ensuring that even beginners can successfully process and analyze their data.
